Sharing My Recent Power BI Project on Coffee Shop Sales Data ☕📊
Working on this project was a wonderful experience where I had the opportunity to dive deeper into Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation, preparing the dataset for meaningful analysis.
👉 The aim of the project was to uncover hidden insights such as the most popular products, customer preferences, sales trends by season and weekday, and performance across delivery modes.
✨ Key Insights from the Analysis:
 1️⃣ The Coffee Shop generated 13.34K in sales by selling 3,215 items within just two months.
 2️⃣ April recorded the highest quantity of items sold.
 3️⃣ Latte emerged as the most demanded product by customers.
 4️⃣ Products in the Drinks category were the top sellers.
 5️⃣ A larger share of orders came through the mobile app.
 6️⃣ Customers preferred takeaway over dine-in and delivery.
 7️⃣ New customers contributed the highest number of orders and sales.
 8️⃣ Among products, Iced Latte generated the highest sales revenue.
 9️⃣ Sales peaked during the rainy season, highlighting the weather’s influence.

📌 This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and deriving business insights using Power BI.
